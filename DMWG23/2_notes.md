# Glossary of Terms – Weak Fiat-Shamir Attacks

---

## Fiat-Shamir Transform (FS)
- A method to remove interaction from a proof protocol by replacing the verifier’s challenge with a hash of the transcript.
- Typically used in zkSNARKs, Bulletproofs, and other proof systems.

---

## Weak Fiat-Shamir (Weak FS)
- A variant of FS where the challenge is generated without including all relevant public inputs.
- Allows adaptive attacks: prover can craft a proof and choose inputs later.

---

## Strong Fiat-Shamir
- FS where the challenge is generated by hashing over the entire transcript, including public inputs and statements.
- Prevents adaptive attacks.

---

## Adaptive Attack
- An attack where the prover chooses the statement (public input) after creating part or all of the proof.
- Breaks the assumption that the prover must commit to the statement before proving.

---

## Soundness
- A security property that ensures only true statements can be proven.
- Knowledge soundness ensures that a valid proof implies knowledge of a valid witness.

---

## Transcript
- The sequence of messages and public data passed between prover and verifier.
- FS replaces verifier’s message by hashing the transcript.

---

## BP-ARP (Bulletproofs – Aggregate Range Proof)
- A zero-knowledge proof system used for proving multiple values lie in a certain range.
- Used in Monero, MimbleWimble, etc.

---

## Merlin
- A transcript management library commonly used in Rust-based ZKP systems.
- Helps enforce proper FS challenge computation via domain separation and transcript state.

---

## VDF (Verifiable Delay Function)
- A cryptographic primitive requiring a known amount of sequential time to compute, but quickly verifiable.
- Wesolowski’s VDF is vulnerable if the delay input is not bound in FS.
